## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I'm Pratham, 23 year old. I completed my B.Tech (2014-2018) in the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at NMAMIT Nitte. My research interests include VLSI, embedded system and programming. During my B.Tech, I worked research projects on Crappy Cash a bio and plastic waste segregator as an initiative to swacch bharath.


Presently, I am exploring various fields that I am not acquanited to. I believe they will ultimately help me to do better research in my field by understanding the needs and concerns of societies. In this journey, I’ve completed more than 5 online courses on the MOOC platforms such as edX and NPTEL.
